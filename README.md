# Spectral framework for model evaluation

---Intro Here ---

-- Figure 1 HERE --

-- Some more indepth explanation here --

The spectral framework consists of three main steps:

1. Defining MSPs and cross-split overlap in each molecular sequencing dataset.
  
2. Constructing MSP graphs and SPECTRA split generation.

3. Generating spectral performance curves.

This repository includes code used to run Spectra on all molecular sequencing datasets considered in the paper <>.
Each molecular sequencing dataset has its own repository containing specific information for how these steps manifest for these datasets.
