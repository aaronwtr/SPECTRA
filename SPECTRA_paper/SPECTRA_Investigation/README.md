# Directory Overview

This directory contains the scripts used to (1) investigate SPECTRA splits to find the spectral parameters and models with high 
test performance standard deviation among splits with the same parameter and (2) use diff-RRDR to explain CNN test performance variance
in three RIF SPECTRA splits.

`diff-RRDR analysis.ipynb` contains all the code used for this analysis.
