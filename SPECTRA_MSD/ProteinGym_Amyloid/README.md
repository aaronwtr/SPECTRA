# Overview of SPECTRA for Amyloid dataset

In this dataset individual samples are represented by a sample barcode or a string representation of the mutations present in the sample.

For example a sample could be "D672V:V710G" indicating a mutation at position 672 from D to V and at 710 from V to G. 
Two samples share a spectral property if they share a mutation.

The Amyloid.ipynb contains the code to run SPECTRA on this dataset. The amyloid_splits directory contains txt files containing details of each split 
generated by SPECTRA where "lambda_0.0.txt" is the details for the split generated at a spectral parameter of 0. Each txt file contains the samples 
in the train and test set for that split.
