# Spectral analysis on mutational scan datasets (MSDs)

We ran SPECTRA on the following datasets:

- Amyloid beta protein aggregation dataset from the ProteinGym benchmark found in the *ProteinGym_Amyloid* directory
- RNA recognition motif (RRM) dataset from the ProteinGym benchmark found in the *ProteinGym_RRM* directory
- Rifampicin resistance prediction in the Tuberculosis dataset from [Green et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31236-0) found in the *TB_Covid_GFP* directory
- Pyrazinamide resistance prediction in the Tuberculosis dataset from [Green et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31236-0) found in the *TB_Covid_GFP* directory
- Isoniazid resistance prediction in the Tuberculosis dataset from [Green et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31236-0) found in the *TB_Covid_GFP* directory
- Green fluorescent protein (GFP) dataset from [Sarkisyan et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17995) found in the *TB_Covid_GFP* directory
- SARS-CoV-2 (Covid) dataset from [Greaney et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7676316/) found in the *TB_Covid_GFP* directory
